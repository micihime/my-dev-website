          <p>Let&apos;s get in touch!</p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I&apos;ve developed strong backend skills with .NET and C#, working on API design, database management, and server-side logic. Recently, 
            I&apos;ve expanded my expertise into the frontend world, mastering React to create visually appealing and highly interactive user interfaces. I believe in 
            full-stack development and enjoy taking projects from concept to deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m always open to exciting new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to get in touch if youâ€™d like to work together or simply share ideas.
