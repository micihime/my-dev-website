<h1>Server-Rendered HTML in Modern Web Development: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

      <p>
        Server-rendered HTML refers to a process where the server generates the
        HTML content of a web page before sending it to the user&apos;s browser.
        This means the page is fully or partially constructed on the server, and
        the browser receives a complete or nearly complete HTML document that
        can be displayed immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Client Request:</strong> The browser (client) sends a request
          to the server for a web page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Server Processing:</strong> The server processes this request,
          fetching data from a database or API, and then renders the HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML Sent to Client:</strong> The server sends the fully
          constructed HTML to the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rendering in Browser:</strong> The browser renders the HTML
          and displays the page to the user.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why It Matters:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Faster Initial Page Load:</strong> Since the server sends a
          complete HTML document, the browser doesn&apos;t need to wait for
          JavaScript to execute to display content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Search engines can easily crawl and
          index server-rendered content since it&apos;s already in the HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> The page works even if
          JavaScript fails or is disabled.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <h3>Server-Rendered:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>User requests example.com/profile</li>
        <li>
          The server fetches user data (e.g., name, bio, picture) from a
          database
        </li>
        <li>The server generates an HTML document:</li>
      </ol>

      <pre>
        <code>
          {`<html>
  <head>
    <title>User Profile</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>John Doe</h1>
    <p>Bio: Software Developer</p>
  </body>
</html>`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2>Frameworks Supporting Server-Rendered HTML:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Next.js:</strong> Server-side rendering (SSR) with
          getServerSideProps
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remix:</strong> Server-rendered by default with loaders
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Use Server-Rendered HTML:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages where SEO is critical (e.g., blogs, e-commerce)</li>
        <li>
          Applications that require fast initial loading (e.g., landing pages)
        </li>
        <li>
          Content that is dynamically fetched and must be up-to-date when the
          user loads the page
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
  );
