          Hi, I&apos;m Mitchie, I&apos;m a full-stack developer specializing in
          C#/.NET on the backend and React on the frontend, building scalable
          and user-friendly web applications. I love building intuitive,
          user-friendly web applications and exploring the world of UI/UX
          design. With a passion for creativity and problem-solving, I strive to
          create digital experiences that are both functional and visually
          engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I love exploring new places, experimenting in baking,
          and staying active through dance, running, and hiking. I try to bring
          curiosity and enthusiasm to everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>Let&apos;s connect and build something great together!</p>
